# med_reminder

A new Flutter project.

##1.Problem:-  
In the modern world where technology is advancing exponentially, we might find it hard to believe that many of the elderly in our society are struggling to use a smartphone. They often forget to take their pills or even forget their dosage. It's hard for them to organize their health reports and keep up with the appointments. Even though there are a lot of apps revolving around these issues but due to their complex nature the elderly find them unclear and confusing. 

##2. Solution: Keeping in mind all the troubles that the older people face we’ve come up with an app to make their lives easier. The solution would be :
Pill Monitor: This feature can remind them to have their pills and their dosage on time without causing mix-ups.This will help them to know when and what to take during the specified time.
RecordSafe: This helps them to scan and store the digital copies of all their health records and prescriptions securely 
SOS: This feature will help to  dial the hospital and their emergency contact in case of an emergency.
VoiceCommands: Can be used to input the data into the app instead of typing since there are many who find it difficult to type , So this feature will help them..
Supervisor: Allows the caregiver of the person to have a linked account in order  to add, edit and update the data.

##3. Improvements:
MoodDiary: Takes constant updates on the person’s mental health and well-being thus helping them to keep a track of it.
PillMonitor: An improvisation that allows them to scan the prescriptions which then automatically sets the pill reminder.

Conclusion: Through this app, we aim to bring a virtual companion which can guide the elderly through old age with ease.
